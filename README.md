### KHAAdotPK (`khaa.pk`)

Welcome to **KHAAdotPK** (`khaa.pk`)! This collection of repositories is meticulously curated to provide a solid foundation for implementing various Machine Learning (ML) models using `C/C++`, `Rust` and `Zig`. The goal is to offer resources that not only enhance your understanding of the core mechanics of these models but also empower you to build robust and innovative machine learning solutions from scratch.

#### Why KHAAdotPK?

This initiative stems from the realization that we are at a pivotal moment in the evolution of AIâ€”comparable to the early stages of other transformative global phenomena. AI today is more than a technological breakthrough; it represents a societal revolution. By demystifying ML and AI implementations, the repositories at KHAAdotPK aim to dismantle the "black box" perception of these technologies, making their mechanics accessible to everyone.

Through this work, I envision a future where individuals, equipped with their own AI agents, can ethically, responsibly, and transparently harness the full potential of this technology.

#### Getting Started

To begin, simply clone the desired repository into the `./lib` directory of your project. Each repository is designed to serve as a standalone guide and resource, offering insights and code examples that reflect real-world applications of machine learning principles.

#### Contribute, Explore, and Innovate

Feel free to explore, experiment with, and adapt the repositories to your needs. The provided guides are crafted to enhance your understanding and practical application of ML models. If you have any questions, suggestions, or are interested in contributing, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback and collaboration are invaluable as we strive to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with ground-up machine learning solutions.

Happy coding!
