<!-- ### KHAAdotPK(`khaa.pk`)
Welcome to the KHAAdotPK(`khaa.pk`)! This collection of repositories has been curated with the intention of providing a foundation for the implementation of various Machine Learning (`ML`) models in `C/C++` and `Rust`. To get started, clone the needed repository into the `./lib` local directory. Each repository is crafted with the hope that it will contribute to and facilitate your journey in building robust and innovative machine learning solutions.

Additionally, this repository has detailed guides on the implementation of `Skip-gram` and `CBOW` models using the software resources available at KHAAdotPK. You can find these guides in the repository as PDF documents:

- [Skip-gram Implementation Guide](./SkipGramImplementation.pdf)
- [CBOW Implementation Guide](./StepByStepCBOW.pdf)

Feel free to `explore`, `experiment`, and `adapt` the cloned repositories and utilize the provided PDF guides to enhance your understanding and application of these ML models. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding! -->
