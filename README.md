### KHAAdotPK (`khaa.pk`)

Welcome to **KHAAdotPK** (`khaa.pk`)! This collection of repositories is curated to provide a strong foundation for implementing various Machine Learning (`ML`) models using `C/C++` and `Rust`. The goal is to offer resources that not only facilitate understanding the core mechanics of these models but also empower developers to build robust and innovative machine learning solutions from scratch.

#### Why KHAAdotPK?

This initiative stems from the realization that we are at a critical juncture in the development of AI, akin to the early days of transformative global phenomena. AI today is not just a technological advancement but a societal revolution. By demystifying ML and AI implementations, the repositories @KHAAdotPK aim to break down the perception of these technologies as "black boxes" and make their mechanics accessible to everyone. Through this work, I envision a future where individuals, equipped with personal AI agents, can harness the full potential of this technology ethically, responsibly, and transparently.

#### Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the desired repository into the `./lib` local directory of your project. Each repository is designed to be a standalone guide and resource, providing insights and code examples that reflect real-world applications of machine learning principles.

#### Contribute, Explore, and Innovate

Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt the cloned repositories. The provided guides are there to enhance your understanding and application of these ML models. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to contribute, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback and collaboration are invaluable as we strive to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with machine learning from the ground up.

Happy coding!
