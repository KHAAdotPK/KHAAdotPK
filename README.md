Welcome to the KHAAdotPK(`khaa.pk`)! This collection of repositories has been curated with the intention of providing a foundation for the implementation of various Machine Learning (ML) models in `C/C++` and `Rust`. To get started, clone the needed repository into the `./lib` local directory. Each repository is crafted with the hope that it will contribute to and facilitate your journey in building robust and innovative machine learning solutions.

Feel free to `explore`, `experiment`, and `adapt` the cloned repositories to meet your specific requirements. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
