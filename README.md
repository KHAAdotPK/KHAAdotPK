### KHAAdotPK (`khaa.pk`)

Welcome to **KHAAdotPK** (`khaa.pk`)! This collection of repositories is curated to provide a strong foundation for implementing various Machine Learning (`ML`) models using `C/C++` and `Rust`. The goal is to offer resources that not only facilitate understanding the core mechanics of these models but also empower developers to build robust and innovative machine learning solutions from scratch.

#### Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the desired repository into the `./lib` local directory of your project. Each repository is designed to be a standalone guide and resource, providing insights and code examples that reflect real-world applications of machine learning principles.

#### Available Guides

We have detailed guides that walk you through the implementation of key ML models, such as `Skip-gram` and `CBOW`. These guides are included as PDF documents within their respective repositories:

- [Skip-gram Implementation Guide](./SkipGramImplementation.pdf): A comprehensive guide on implementing the Skip-gram model, a foundational algorithm in natural language processing, using `C/C++`.
- [CBOW Implementation Guide](./StepByStepCBOW.pdf): A step-by-step guide for implementing the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model in `C/C++`, offering insights into word embedding techniques and their applications.

#### Where We Are Heading

At **KHAAdotPK**, the journey doesn't stop with Skip-gram and CBOW. We are currently expanding our focus to more advanced models, including the implementation of Transformer architectures, such as the Encoder-Decoder models, entirely from scratch. This ambitious effort aims to build a comprehensive library of fundamental ML models that are not only educational but also optimized for performance and scalability.

Our long-term vision is to provide tools and resources that enable businesses to harness the power of custom ML models, trained on in-house data, to drive insights and innovation. By continuing to develop these foundational models in `C/C++` and `Rust`, we aim to bridge the gap between high-level ML frameworks and the performance needs of commercial applications.

#### Current Status and Future Plans

Unfortunately, development work has been temporarily paused due to the passing of my father on June 5th of this year. During this period, progress has understandably slowed as I take time to process this loss. However, I plan to resume development in the coming months, with renewed focus and dedication to continuing this project.

#### Contribute, Explore, and Innovate

Feel free to explore, experiment, and adapt the cloned repositories. The provided guides are there to enhance your understanding and application of these ML models. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to contribute, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback and collaboration are invaluable as we strive to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with machine learning from the ground up.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your support during this time.

Happy coding!
